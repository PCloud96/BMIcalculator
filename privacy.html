        <p>BMI Calculator ("the App") is developed and operated by Cloud Motion Lab LLC. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we handle it.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All health data you enter (height, weight, age, gender) is stored locally on your device only. We do not have access to this data.</p>

        <h2>No Account Required</h2>
        <p>The App does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information to use it.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers a one-time in-app purchase processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or have access to your payment information. All transactions are handled by Apple.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>BMI history and preferences are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data is not backed up to any external server. If you delete the App, all locally stored data is permanently removed.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
